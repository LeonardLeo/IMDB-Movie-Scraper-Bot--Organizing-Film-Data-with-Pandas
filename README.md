# IMDB Movie Scraper Bot

## Overview
The IMDB Movie Scraper Bot is a Python-based tool designed to automate the extraction of movie data from IMDb's website. It aims to simplify the process of gathering comprehensive movie information for analysis and decision-making in the entertainment industry. The IMDB Movie Scraper Bot is a web scraping tool designed to extract movie data from the IMDb website. Leveraging Python's BeautifulSoup library, the bot navigates through IMDb's movie listings, retrieving information such as movie title, release year, runtime, genre, certificate, rating, director, stars, votes, and gross earnings. The extracted data is then organized into a structured format using the Pandas library in Python.
